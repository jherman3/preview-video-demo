# Preview video demo

A small test site to demo the video preview functionality of [ngerakines/preview](http://github.com/ngerakines/preview) using video.js and its HLS plugin

## Usage
Start a web server, such as Python's SimpleHTTPServer, in the project directory.
Running the preview.pl script will execute a preview command to render a video and write the video's URL to source.json, which is loaded by the site.
